# thingiverse-cli
CLI to easily download 3d printer .stl's, store them in temp location and open them in the slicer of your choice.

## Notes

- Not sure if we need the Thingivese access token, maybe should switch to all public urls?

## Future

- Command to open the downloads folder in file explorer
- Flesh out documentation
- Clear the temp folder
- if the stl already existis do not redownload
- append stl to open slicer rather then always over wright
